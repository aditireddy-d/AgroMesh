- `power_management.pdf` – Replaceable and rechargeable battery setup

## Setup Instructions

1. Assemble the sensor node according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the firmware from the `firmware/` directory.
3. Test each sensor individually to verify correct operation.
4. Configure the WiFi module for data transmission.
5. Deploy the unit in the field with proper weather protection.

## Power Management

The sensor node is designed to operate on solar power with battery backup. The power management system includes:
- Battery protection circuit
- Low power consumption optimization
- Power button for turning the unit on/off

## Maintenance

- Clean the sensor probes after use to ensure accuracy.
- Check the battery health every 3 months.
- Update the firmware periodically to add features or fix bugs.
- Inspect and replace the weather protection enclosure annually if needed.
